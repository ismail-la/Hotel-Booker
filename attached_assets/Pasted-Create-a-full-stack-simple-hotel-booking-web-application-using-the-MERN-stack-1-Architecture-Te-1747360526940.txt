Create a full-stack simple hotel booking web application using the MERN stack:
1. Architecture & Tech Stack:
   - Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB (with Mongoose ODM)
   - Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS, React Router for navigation
   - State Management: Redux or Context API for user state and booking flow
   - Authentication: JWT-based signup and login
   - Deployment: Ready for deployment on Heroku (backend) and Vercel (frontend)

2. Pages & Components:
   a. Home / Hotel Listing:
      - Display a searchable, paginated list of hotels (max 5 hotels)
      - Each hotel card shows image, name, location, price per night
      - Filters by date range, location, price range
   b. Hotel Detail:
      - Show photo gallery, description, amenities
      - Display available rooms with date-picker availability checks
   c. Booking Flow:
      - Multi-step form to select room, dates, guest info
      - Real-time price calculation
      - “Confirm Booking” button triggering a reservation API call
   d. User Dashboard:
      - List of past and upcoming bookings
      - Ability to cancel or view details of each booking
   e. Admin Dashboard:
      - CRUD management for hotels, rooms, and reservations
      - Simple data table views with add/edit/delete modals

3. API Endpoints (Express):
   - `GET /api/hotels`, `GET /api/hotels/:id`
   - `POST /api/auth/signup`, `POST /api/auth/login`
   - `POST /api/bookings`, `GET /api/users/:id/bookings`
   - Protected routes for admin to manage hotels and rooms

4. UI Details:
   - Clean, modern layout with responsive design
   - Use Tailwind utility classes for spacing and typography
   - Consistent header with logo and navigation links
   - Mobile-first approach with hamburger menu

5. Next Steps:
   - Scaffold the project structure (`client/` and `server/` folders)
   - Install dependencies (`npm install` in both)
   - Generate boilerplate code for each page and API route
   - Run dev servers (`npm run dev` for backend, `npm start` for frontend)
